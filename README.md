# Dropship Chess
![splash_screen](img/instructions.jpg)

Chess played on a 6x6 board.

You can "drop" enemy pieces you've captured anywhere on the board as your own.

White starts with two knights and Black with two bishopsâ€”so you have to capture
the opponent's knights/bishops to get your own!

Here, Black captures White's knight.

Black can now drop the knight to push the attack.
